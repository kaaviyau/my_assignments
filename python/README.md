PREFACE
Did you know there are many benefits to listening to music? Crank up the tunes and blast those
beats, because the results are in — music is good for you. Music can soothe the broken hearted,
motivate runners, and kick off the most epic dance parties, but it also has some serious scientific
benefits for our health and overall wellbeing. Listening to music has been shown to improve
memory functioning, increase rate of healing, improve your workouts and more. Music is the
best communication in the world. It lowers stress and improves health, improves running
performance, helps you sleep better, reduces depression, and boosts learning and memory.
Music exerts a powerful influence on human beings.
Music is a universal language. It can unite people from all around the world who have different
native languages, cultures, and religions. The music of their past connects them to a common
aspect of humanity. In music, we find a type of emotional literacy that speaks to us in a way that
transcends culture or language. Music can communicate emotions and memories that words
cannot express. It is a way for people to connect with each other on a deeper level.
Our project – ‘AURA’, is a music database that allows users to use connect with their favourite
tunes through our song recommendation feature, look at the top charts, and organize their
preferred songs in playlists.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Our project consists of a database of music. It organizes music to make it easy for a user to
connect with the songs that they like. It also is an all-in-one library which can be used by anyone,
including children.
Through our program, users are able to:
 view songs along with their genre, lyrics, amount of likes and views (indicators of
popularity), and the song length
 view a chart of the current top songs based on popularity and genre
 create playlists (a list of songs or pieces of music) and view them
With these features, this database of music is perfectly curated for the ultimate music lover and
for people who just want to listen to good music. With its wide appeal and the fact that it is very
easy to use makes it ideal for anyone.

EXISTING INEFFICIENT SYSTEMS
Currently, many systems are available to sort and search for music. These include services such
as Spotify and iMusic. These systems allow a user to create an account and save their liked
songs, playlists, and use these details for future reference. However there are a few inefficiencies
which exist such as the lack of a top songs chart based on user reactions and an extensive system
for filtering songs. The AURA database is a solution to these problems and is focused on
providing an interface that is easy for the user to use while also having key features that allow
the user to access more data.

OBJECTIVES
It allows not just easy access for the user but it makes it just as easy for the admins to maintain
the database.
Our project’s objectives include:
 An easy access to details about specific songs.
 Our search feature allows the user to enter the name of the song to instantly obtain a
collection of characteristics such as the genre, song length, lyrics, and its popularity.
 The user is able to create playlists.
 They can update, add and delete songs in the playlist. This allows users to keep track of
the songs that they enjoy and save it in their history for later use.
 A likes feature where an user is able to add a user reaction to a song.
 The top charts allow the user to view a list of songs organized by their likes and views.
Users are able to discover new songs and find out the new trending hits.
 The sign-up and login features allow the user to save songs in a playlist. This allows them
to be able to access their previously curated playlists every time they use the database.
 Easy maintenance for the admins to update the database with new songs and with new
rankings for the top songs charts
Through these features, we have created a database which is accessible by anyone.
The organization of music is essential if we want to find tracks that are enjoyable and the AURA
database makes it very easy to find the music that we need and want to listen to.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
A. IMPLEMENTATION
The implementation is initiated after the system has been tested and accepted by the user. In this
phase, the system is installed to support the intended business functions. System performance is
compared to performance objectives established during planning. Implementation includes user
notification, user training, installation of hardware, installation of software onto production
computers, and integration of the system into daily work processes. This continues until the
system is operating in production in accordance with the defined user requirements.
Front-end and Back-End:
Front-end and back-end development are quite different from each other, but still, they are two
aspects of the same situation.The front-end is the part of the website users can see and interact.
The back-end, on the contrary, is the part of the website users cannot see and interact with. The
visual aspects of the website that can be seen and experienced by users are frontend. On the other
hand, everything that happens in the background can be attributed to the backend.
Our project uses SQL as the back-end and Python as the front-end. The SQL back-end is the
server-side of the project. It stores and arranges data in the form of tables, and also makes sure
everything on the admin side of the project work fine. It is the portion of software that does not
come in direct contact with the users. The parts and characteristics developed by back-end are
indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.

B. PROJECT SYSTEMS:
From the initial welcome page, a user is able to login and then
access different functions. Administrators are able to edit and update the database with new
songs and rankings in the top charts. Anyone using the database is able to use the song
recommendations function to find a music of their preference. The top charts method can be used
to see a variety of different charts based on genre and popularity.
The song recommendations function is used to determine multiple songs of a users preference by
obtaining data on their favourite artists, genre, etc. The algorithm is able to filter the entire
database and retrieve songs which are recommended to the user. This helps users find new songs
easily.
