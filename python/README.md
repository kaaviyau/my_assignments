# AURA Music Database

## PREFACE

Did you know there are many benefits to listening to music? Crank up the tunes and blast those beats, because the results are in — music is good for you. Music can soothe the broken-hearted, motivate runners, and kick off the most epic dance parties, but it also has some serious scientific benefits for our health and overall well-being. Listening to music has been shown to improve memory functioning, increase the rate of healing, improve your workouts, and more. Music is the best communication in the world. It lowers stress and improves health, enhances running performance, helps you sleep better, reduces depression, and boosts learning and memory. Music exerts a powerful influence on human beings.

Music is a universal language. It can unite people from all around the world who have different native languages, cultures, and religions. The music of their past connects them to a common aspect of humanity. In music, we find a type of emotional literacy that speaks to us in a way that transcends culture or language. Music can communicate emotions and memories that words cannot express. It is a way for people to connect with each other on a deeper level.

Our project – 'AURA,' is a music database that allows users to connect with their favorite tunes through our song recommendation feature, explore top charts, and organize their preferred songs into playlists.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Our project consists of a comprehensive music database designed to make it easy for users to connect with the songs they love. It's an all-in-one music library suitable for users of all ages.

Through our program, users can:
- View songs along with their genre, lyrics, number of likes, views (indicators of popularity), and song length.
- Explore a chart of the current top songs based on popularity and genre.
- Create and manage playlists, allowing them to curate their music experience.

With these features, our music database is tailored for music enthusiasts and anyone looking for a convenient way to enjoy great music. Its user-friendly design makes it accessible to everyone.

## EXISTING INEFFICIENT SYSTEMS

Currently, many systems are available for sorting and searching for music, such as Spotify and iMusic. While these services allow users to create accounts and save their favorite songs and playlists, they do have some inefficiencies. These include a lack of a top songs chart based on user reactions and limited song filtering capabilities. The AURA database addresses these issues and focuses on providing a user-friendly interface with essential features for accessing music data efficiently.

## OBJECTIVES

Our project not only provides easy access for users but also simplifies database maintenance for administrators. Our project's objectives include:

- Providing easy access to details about specific songs.
- Enabling users to search for songs by name and instantly obtain various characteristics, such as genre, song length, lyrics, and popularity.
- Allowing users to create and manage playlists.
- Implementing a "likes" feature for users to express their reactions to songs.
- Offering top charts based on user likes and views for discovering new music.
- Providing sign-up and login features for saving songs in playlists.

These features create a versatile music database accessible to anyone. Organizing music is essential for finding enjoyable tracks, and the AURA database makes it easy to discover and enjoy the music you love.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### A. IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation phase begins after system testing and user acceptance. It includes the installation and configuration of the system to support its intended business functions. Implementation involves user notification, training, hardware and software installation, and system integration into daily work processes. It continues until the system operates in production in accordance with defined user requirements.

### Front-end and Back-end:

Front-end and back-end development are distinct but interconnected aspects of the same system. The front-end represents the visible and interactive part of the website, while the back-end handles server-side functions and data storage. Our project employs SQL as the back-end and Python as the front-end. SQL manages data storage and admin-side functions, while Python handles user interactions and presentation. This division ensures efficient data management and user-friendly interfaces.

### B. PROJECT SYSTEMS:

From the initial welcome page, users can log in and access various functions. Administrators can edit and update the database with new songs and rankings for top charts. Users can use the song recommendation function to discover music tailored to their preferences. The top charts feature provides a variety of charts based on genre and popularity.

The song recommendation function uses an algorithm to suggest multiple songs based on user preferences, including favorite artists and genres. This algorithm filters the entire database, helping users easily discover new songs.
