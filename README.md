## Assignment #1: Docker

I successfully followed the tutorial, completing all assigned tasks in the terminal. This immersive experience allowed me to gain proficiency in various aspects of Docker. Throughout the process, I acquired essential skills, such as:

- Creating containers
- Pulling containers from repositories
- Running containers
- Executing scripts within containers
- Proficiently removing containers when needed
- Grasped the concept of deploying static websites using Docker (both with the provided port settings and custom ports)

This practical knowledge proved invaluable as it demonstrated Docker's capacity to host websites efficiently, eliminating the need for resource-intensive virtual machines.

In summary, this assignment solidified my understanding of Docker and its utility in simplifying website hosting, making it an indispensable tool for modern web development.
